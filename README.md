# Anime-Recommendation-System
Sequel to conducting an analysis of anime shows where I analyzed all anime shows till date and created a dashboard that provides insights on relevant information of anime shows. I took a further advanced step and have now built a machine learning recommendation system. The recommendation system is a python function code that return similar anime suggestions on basis of genre similarity. The system mainly employs use of sklearn.
